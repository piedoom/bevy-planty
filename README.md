This repository has been permanently removed from Microsoft's GitHub due to their constant reprehensible and disgusting actions, such as providing [critical resources to ICE](https://github.com/drop-ice/dear-github-2.0) in their conquest to displace and murder as many migrant families as possible, as well as their flagrant disregard of licensing (and human ingenuity) through a giant [code laundering machine with no opt-out](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/39361#discussioncomment-4186551), which is similar to real laundry machines in that it [uses a bunch of water](https://fortune.com/2023/09/09/ai-chatgpt-usage-fuels-spike-in-microsoft-water-consumption/), but instead of clean clothes, it produces code with an oily shit patina and a vague scent of blood.
